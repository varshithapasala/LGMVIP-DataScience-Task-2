Next Word Prediction:

This project is a part of the Let's Grow More Data Science Internship program. It focuses on building a next word prediction model.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project consists of a large collection of text documents, such as books, articles, or any other textual data. The dataset is preprocessed to extract the necessary information for building the language model.

Next Word Prediction Project.ipynb: Google Colab Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Next Word Prediction Dataset.txt: The preprocessed dataset file. Requirements The following libraries are required to run the notebook: Python,nltk,numpy,tensorflow,keras
